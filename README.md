We design a FAST corner detection accelerator, and calculate by the formula:

<div align="center">
  <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\huge%20\frac{T_{clock}\times%20F_{max}}{\tau_{Simulation}}">
</div>

Use 7ns for the clock period in Synthesis and run Cosimulation, you will get the score 10319.54.
